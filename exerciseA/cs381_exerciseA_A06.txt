Purpose: Provide a discription of the web page
	 http://www.cs.uaf.edu/2013/fall/cs381/code/check_webgl.html
	 for exercise A of assignment 6.

	The web page has a title of 'Check that WebGL Works'. In the top left
of the page is a 4 lines of text. They are: Is WebGL working?, Space Restart 
bouncing, R Toggle rotation, [] Change rotation speed. The background color
of the web page is a light shade of brown. When the page is first accessed,
there is a light pink, rotating, bouncing torus. There are also lighting
effects on the surface of the torus. There is the diffuse lighting including
the specular highlights from some light source that appears to be coming from
the direction of the viewer. 
	After an amount of time, the bouncing of the torus becomes less to the
point that the torus comes to rest at the bottom of the screen. If the user as 
not interacted with the keyboard, then the torus will continue to rotate
there. The r key, shifted or not, will cause the torus to change the rotating
state of the torus, it will also cause the text field in the documentation
from off to ON depending on the state. The [ key will cause the rotation speed
of the torus to decrease. While the ] key will cause an increase in the rotation
speed of the torus. When the spacebar is press, the torus will have an effect
of added energy that will make the torus to bounce more. Resizing the window
keeps the aspect of the page. There are no easter eggs :(
